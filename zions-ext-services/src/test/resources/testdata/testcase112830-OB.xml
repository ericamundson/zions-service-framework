  <ns3:title xmlns:ns3="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">CL Access and Transaction Rules</ns3:title>
  <ns3:description xmlns:ns3="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">For Commercial Loans sourced by BaNCS the customer's view and transaction access rights are controlled by the Channel Access Flag and Channel Access Apply Flag. These are maintained and managed by BaNCS

The Channel Access field (values F,N,O,T or V) defines the access rights at the Product level.

Channel Access Flag Values:

F: Debits &amp; view only
N: No access allowed
O: All access allowed
T: Credits &amp; view only
V: View only access

The Channel Access flag is a static parameter for a product and the BaNCS system enforces standard Product access rights across all Affiliate banks.

For further granularity, based on dynamic rules, an additional access flag (ChannelAccessApply) is also provided at the account level by BaNCS. This flag further restricts access in specific cases e.g. Matured Line of Credit. 

1: NO Access
2: View Only – No Transactions
3: View and Make Advances
4: View and Make Payments
5: ALL Access – View, Payments &amp; Advances

The second level flag is an override that is intended to be more restrictive than Channel Access Flag.

Online Banking (batch and real-time) will look at both flags and apply the MOST RESTRICTIVE when determining the customer access.

For the details of the rules implemented by BaNCS reference the linked excel file 'Channel Access Apply Rules.xls' (source:  BaNCS OB Batch Extract File Interface Specification: IOF-223-OLBK-01-B06 CL Interface)
